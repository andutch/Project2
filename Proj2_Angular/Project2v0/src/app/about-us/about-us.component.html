        After leaving military service, I earned a Baccalaureate degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado. My professional experience includes design of custom test equipment, manufacturing support, thermal and flow control of fluid systems, automation software development, and endurance testing of aircraft parts.
        Recently I have made a career change from Mechanical Engineering into Software because I enjoy the fast pace at which the field is growing and the vast intellectual opportunities it offers.

        US Navy Veteran that served for 10 years as an Electrician's Mate (Shipboard Electrician). My military career was full of challenges that pushed me into resolving situations creatively, fast, and under pressure. Now that I have completed my active duty service, I am pursuing a career in a field in which I’ve truly been interested since I was young. Looking forward to new types of challenges and the impact that my contributions may have.

        Navy Combat Veteran. Worked as a member of a team to complete a full stack inventory management application. The app provides a company the ability to create, read, update, and delete items from the system and have the items stored in a database. The app covers edge cases through input validation, boundary checking, and unit testing. The app itself was built using Java Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL.
